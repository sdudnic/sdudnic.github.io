Subject: Application for Doctoral student – Emerging Technologies for Bacterial Spore Control 

Dear Prof. Alexander Mathys,

I am writing to express my interest in pursuing a PhD in Food Processing at ETH Zurich's Institute of Food, Nutrition and Health.

[The first paragraph should contain a self-introduction. You should write who you are, where your expertise lies, where you found the job posting, and why you want to apply for the job.]

I am submitting my resume for consideration towards the PhD in Food Processing position, found on the Polytechnikum's site. My five years of experience in various microbiology laboratories combined with a Master in Food Engineering degree, which I will obtain in June, make me an ideal candidate for this position.

[The second paragraph should respond directly to the job description written by the hiring manager. Describe how your previous job experiences, skills, and abilities will allow you to meet the company's needs. To make that easier, you can (and should) literally include words and phrases from the job description in your cover letter.
 	You can include a bulleted list of your accomplishments
 	Make sure you quantify (add numbers to) these bullet points
 	A cover letter with numbers is 100% better than one without]
I am highly curious to do research in the control of the bacterial spores, as it targets one of the main problem of food industry - the food preservation from bacterial contamination. Development of new strategies to control the bacterial spores including mild and innovative germination-inactivation can lower the thermal load needed to inactivate bacterial spores and thus preserve food quality better. As I am interested in extending my knowledge in microbiology and bacterial physiology, the participation in the project will allow me mastering the advanced analytical technologies such as flow cytometry, fluorescence activated cell sorting and transmission electron microscopy, etc.  

Working in a food control quality lab, I operate on daily basis with bacteria, mold, yeast and other microorganisms, working also on a study on how to obtain cellulosic food biofilm from kombucha for a conference in may.
 
My Master thesis studies the effect of cultivation conditions on the biosynthesis of the color pigments from fungal genus Monascus. After obtaining it, I wish to continue my PhD studies career in the food industry, considering that the alimentation is one of most important factors of human’s existence.

I have had some experience in microbiology and writing scientific articles and supporting the ideas in front of the public by participating in student scientific conferences. In addition, I am very ambitious, curious and open for new experience and knowledge. I like the idea to study in the ETH Zurich, one of the top universities in the world. This would be a great opportunity for me to extend my knowledge in the field and become closer to my far-reaching plans to become an independent investigator and university professor. All this would allow me to contribute to the development and innovation of food industry as well to the transfer of knowledge in this field to new generations.

I am one of the best students in my specialization in my Universty, volunteered in students organizations, active participated in multiple scientific conferences and gatherings, issued several scientific publications, listed in the attached CV. I am strongly motivated to become closer to my far-reaching plans to become an independent investigator and university professor, excited to take the chance working with your group, sure to find in the ETH Zurich - one of the top universities in the world - a great laboratory with enhanced technical possibilities and a motivated team with modern team management.

[To go the extra mile, do some research about the company, and try to find out what they are doing - and why - given the current state of their industry. Explain how you can fit into that schema, and help push the company forward and achieve any goals you suspect they may have.]
[The final paragraph is called the "call to action" portion of your cover letter. Inform them that you'd love to get interviewed. Give them your contact information. Tell them that you'll be in contact with them in a week if you don't hear back. Thank them for spending the time to read your cover letter.]
I look forward to your reply. Let me recontact you in a week just to be sure of the receipt of my application. Thank you for your time and consideration of my cover letter and application. 

Sincerely,
[Signature]

I would like to express my interest for work on a project that aims on controlling bacterial spores with a mild and innovative germination-inactivation strategy.  
Over the years of study I have become more interested in the food microbiology and food safety and I am pursuing to develop my professional skills in this field. 



Also I am concerned with microbiology, food safety and the consumer’s education. 
I am very ambitious, curious and open for new experiences and knowledge. I wish very much to continue my studies (PhD) and career in this field, finding that alimentation is one of important factors of human’s existence. I want to become a scientist and university professor in the future, so that I could contribute to the enhancement and innovation of food science, as well to the guidance of new generations in this field. 
I look forward to having the chance to be part of The Sustainable Food Processing group. Thank you for taking the time to consider my application.
