Dear Professor Alexander Mathys,


I am submitting my resume for consideration towards the PhD in Food Processing position, found on the specialized site academicpositions.com. My five years of experience in various microbiology laboratories combined with a Master in Food Engineering degree, which I will obtain in June, make me an ideal candidate for this position.

Currently, my Master thesis studies the effect of cultivation conditions on the biosynthesis of the color pigments from fungal genus Monascus. After obtaining it, I wish to continue my PhD studies career in the food industry, considering that the alimentation is one of most important factors of human’s existence.

I think I’m suitable for this project because I
* am one of the first students in my field of the Universty by academic performance, 
* have high communication skills, as volunteered in students organizations, supporting the ideas in front of the public in multiple scientific conferences and competitions, issued group scientific publications (listed in the CV),
* am strongly motivated to become closer to my far-reaching plans to become an independent investigator and university professor, allowing me to contribute to the development and innovation of food industry as well to the transfer of knowledge in this field to new generations,
* am very ambitious and open to recieve and share the new experience and knowledge.

I am highly curious to study the bacterial spores proliferation, as it targets one of the main problem of food industry - the food preservation from bacterial contamination. Working in a food control quality lab, I face the consequences of this problem. I operate with bacteria, mold, yeast and other microorganisms in food samples that I recieve daily for quality control. I believe that the development of new innovative strategies to control the bacterial spores including the germination-inactivation one can lower the thermal load needed to inactivate bacterial spores and thus preserve food quality better[?]. 

The participation in the project will allow me extending my knowledge in microbiology and bacterial physiology, mastering such advanced analytical technologies as flow cytometry, fluorescence activated cell sorting, transmission electron microscopy and another ones that I hope to discover during this research.

I am excited to take the chance working with the Sustainable Food Processing Group, sure to find in the ETH Zurich - one of the world's top universities in science & technology - a great laboratory with leading technical possibilities and a motivated team with modern team management.

I look forward to your reply. Let me recontact you in a week just to be sure of the receipt of my application. Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. 


Sincerely,


Marina Pihurov
